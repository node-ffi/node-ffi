node-ffi
========
### Node.js Foreign Function Interface [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rbranson/node-ffi.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rbranson/node-ffi)

`node-ffi` is a Node.js addon for loading and calling dynamic libraries using pure JavaScript. It can be used to create bindings to native libraries without writing any C++ code.

It also simplifies the augmentation of node.js with C code as it takes care of handling the translation of types across JavaScript and C, which can add reams of boilerplate code to your otherwise simple C. See the `example/factorial` for an example of this use case.

**WARNING**: node-ffi assumes you know what you're doing. You can pretty easily create situations where you will segfault the interpreter and unless you've got C debugger skills, you probably won't know what's going on.


Example
-------

``` js
var ffi = require('ffi');

var libm = ffi.Library('libm', { 'ceil': [ 'double', [ 'double' ] ] });
libm.ceil(1.5); // 2

// You can also access just functions in the current process by passing a null
var current = ffi.Library(null, { 'atoi': [ 'int32', [ 'string' ] ] });
current.atoi('1234'); // 1234
```


Requirements
------------

 * Linux, OS X, Windows, or Solaris.
 * `libffi` comes bundled with node-ffi, it does not need to be installed on your system.
 * The current version is tested to run on node 0.6.x and 0.7.x.


Installation
------------

``` bash
$ npm install ffi
```

Source Install / Manual Compilation
-----------------------------------

To compile from source it's easiest to use
[`node-gyp`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp):

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-gyp
```

Now you can compile `node-ffi`:

``` bash
$ git clone git://github.com/rbranson/node-ffi.git
$ cd node-ffi
$ node-gyp configure build
```


Types
-----

The types that you specify in function declarations correspond to ref's types
system. So [see that](https://github.com/TooTallNate/ref#built-in-types) for a reference if you are unfamiliar.


V8 and 64-bit Types
-------------------

Internally, V8 stores integers that will fit into a 32-bit space in a 32-bit integer, and those that fall outside of this get put into double-precision floating point numbers. This is problematic because FP numbers are imprecise. To get around this, the methods in node-ffi that deal with 64-bit integers return strings and can accept strings as parameters.

Call Overhead
-------------

There is non-trivial overhead associated with FFI calls. Comparing a hard-coded binding version of `strtoul()` to an FFI version of `strtoul()` shows that the native hard-coded binding is 5x faster. So don't just use the C version of a function just because it's faster. There's a significant cost in FFI calls, so make them worth it.
